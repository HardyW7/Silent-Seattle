A 'crowd-sourced' collection of places of interest in Seattle. Please offer us places that you find interesting but are likely yet unknown to most of us.

(Many of these are going to be represented as points, but some of them may be polygons or lines. All of them should have attribute data filled out. Each student in 458 contributes at least one point.)
